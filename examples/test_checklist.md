# Responsible AI Checklist for LLM Projects

## 5. Ethical Considerations
- [ ] How will you assess and mitigate potential biases in the LLM's outputs?
- [ ] What measures will you implement to prevent generating harmful or toxic content?
- [ ] How will you ensure the LLM respects privacy and data protection regulations?
- [ ] Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?
- [ ] Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?
- [ ] Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?
